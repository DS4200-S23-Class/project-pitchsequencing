    <h1>MLB Pitch Sequencing Analysis</h1>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
       <p>While baseball may not be as popular as other sports right now, it is definitely growing in popularity among the youth. One major pro that baseball has over other forms of entertainment is the accessibility to the average user. There are hundreds of “random” statistics that represent distinct combinations of attributes, but most of them are quite simple to understand and apply. 
	In addition, the Houston Astros made the headlines a few years ago for cheating via illegally sign stealing using technology. Baseball has always had an issue with stealing signs for pitches, but I want to focus on pitch sequencing, specifically in high pressure situations like playoff games. The best pitchers not only have the best “stuff”, but are also the most unpredictable; the batters have no idea what’s coming which always puts them behind, or they do know what’s coming and simply cannot get good contact on the ball. 
	The end user for my project would definitely be a playoff caliber team such as the Astros, Dodgers, or Yankees. The use case of the project would be to help the specific team using the project to identify a pitcher’s likely pitches in an at-bat given the previous pitches thrown, the current inning and scoreline, among other factors. In addition, I would like to analyze the catchers for a given team, since they actually call the pitches. Obviously, the pitcher has some influence, but generally the catcher is the one controlling the sequencing. 
	To obtain this, the user would load the data into python, Tableau or another programming tool. The user would then be able to enter the current attributes for a specific pitch in a game, and produce visualizations showing the likelihood of a specific pitch to be thrown.</p>
