        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
        Baseball analytics encapsulates hundreds of “random” yet useful statistics that represent distinct combinations of attributes, and most of them are quite simple to understand and apply. Given baseball's long history of sign stealing, and the Houston Astros controversy from a few years ago for cheating via illegally sign stealing using technology, we wanted to focus on predicting a given pitch's pitch type or location. 
        </p>

        <p>
        With baseball's recent steep rise in popularity due to the aforementioned cheating scandal and due to various content creators' marketing, and with the transition to PitchCom for communicating pitch sequences, we believe now is an amazing opportunity to attempt to predict a pitcher's pitch sequence of pitch types and pitch locations. 
        </p>

        <p>
    	The end user for this project would be a playoff caliber team such as the Astros, Dodgers or Yankees, and the average fan. The use case of the project would be to help the user to predict the pitcher’s next pitch type and pitch location in an at-bat given the previous pitches thrown, the count and scoreline, among other factors. To obtain this, the user would input data: a pitcher, scoreline, count, etc. This would produce visualizations showing the likelihood of a specific pitch type to be thrown, or the likely location for the next pitch.
